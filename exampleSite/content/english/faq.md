### What is an adventure race?
An adventure race (also called a Raid) is a combination of two or more endurance disciplines, usually including orienteering, off-trail running and/or hiking, mountain biking and canoeing.

### Do I have to be an athlete to take part in the jackalope 2023 challenge?
No. Although it's a demanding endurance event, the Jackalope Challenge is not just for athletes.
During your race, you'll have to make decisions that will influence the length of your race.
(e.g. whether or not to go for certain checkpoints).
To a certain extent, you'll be able to modulate your route according to your level of energy and motivation.
Basic experience in all the disciplines involved in the race is strongly recommended.
However, previous experience in adventure racing is not required.

### Is the course marked?
No. The course is unmarked, so you'll need to navigate with your maps and a compass.


### What orienteering skills are required?
As this is an unmarked course, you'll need to be able to read and orient yourself with a map.
Some checkpoints will be on trails, intersections and other obvious features. To validate advanced checkpoints, you'll need a compass, magnetic declination, UTM coordinates and other orientation notions.
