### Disciplines

**Mountain biking, running/trekking, and kayaking**. Each of these requires map and compass navigation. The distances listed below are subject to slight variations from the final course. This is a demanding endurance event. While it's not exclusively for athletes, participants should have experience in all the disciplines covered by the race.


### Course üó∫Ô∏è

Teams will cover approximately 150 km on an unmarked course, navigating with maps and compass. The course is designed to challenge experienced teams while offering new teams the chance to experience a longer race format. Optional checkpoints will be included so that each team can choose a level of difficulty matching their goals. We expect that only a minority of teams will collect all the checkpoints. The course remains secret until the day before the race.


### Duration

The race will last between **8 and 12 hours (per day)** depending on your route choices, checkpoint selections, and speed. There will be time cutoffs at various stages of the course.


### Teams

Teams of 2 - men, women, or mixed.


### Logistics

The organization will handle the transportation of bins, bikes, and kayaks if needed. Teams will have access to their bins at certain transitions between disciplines. **The kayak is supplied with your registration** and the model will be as follows: https://www.rtmkayaks.com/optimo-evo-confort/
