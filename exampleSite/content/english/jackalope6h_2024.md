The Jackalope Challenge is a multi-sport adventure race that will take place on May 18, 2024. This event aims to offer teams a memorable sporting and human adventure, while showcasing the beauty and attractions of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region.

### Disciplines

**Mountain biking, running/trekking and kayaking**. All require map and compass navigation. The distances indicated below may vary slightly from the final route. You must have experience in all disciplines covered by the race.


### Course

Teams will traverse an unmarked course of around 35 km, orienting themselves with map and compass. This event is aimed at those wishing to discover the sport, or at athletes looking for a shorter challenge. As such, several checkpoints will be optional, so that each team can choose a level of difficulty to suit its objectives. The course will remain secret until the day before the race.

### Duration

The duration of the race will vary between 5-6 hours, depending on your choice of routes, checkpoints and speed. There will be time barriers at various points along the route.


### Teams

Teams of 2 - men, women or mixed.

### Logistics

The organization will take care of transporting bins, bikes and kayaks if required. Teams will have access to their bins at certain transitions between disciplines. The kayak is supplied with your registration and the model will be as follows: https://www.rtmkayaks.com/optimo-evo-confort/
