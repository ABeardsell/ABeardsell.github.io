  The RIKICO orienteering and adventure club announces the first edition of the Jackalope Challenge on June 5, 2022, in the Rimouski region. The 12h Challenge is a multi-sport adventure race involving mountain biking, trail running/walking and canoeing. Participants must validate checkpoints on an unmarked course, using a map and compass. The complete course will remain secret until the day before the race.

### Teams

Teams of two - men, women or co-ed.

### Logistics

Teams will have access to bins at transitions. The race organizers will take care of transporting bikes and canoes if required.

### What to expect

The basic course is accessible and achievable for all sporting levels, while the advanced checkpoints will provide a sporting and orienteering challenge for teams who wish to do so. The distances indicated below vary according to your decisions and whether you go for the advanced checkpoints.

### Duration

The duration of the race will vary between 8 and 12 hours, depending on your choice of route and speed.
