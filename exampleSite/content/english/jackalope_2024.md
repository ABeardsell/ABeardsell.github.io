The Jackalope Challenge is a multi-sport adventure race taking place over 2 days (in stages) on May 18 and 19, 2024. The event aims to offer teams a memorable adventure, while showcasing the beauty and attractions of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. This race is part of the Adventure Racing World Series:

### Disciplines

Mountain biking, running/trekking and kayaking. Each requires navigation. The distances indicated below may vary slightly from the final route. This race is a demanding endurance event. Although it is not reserved for athletes, you should have experience in all the disciplines covered by the race.


### Course

Teams will traverse approximately 150 km, on an unmarked course, orienting themselves with map and compass. The course is designed to challenge experienced teams, while offering new teams the opportunity to experience a longer race format. As such, several checkpoints will be optional so that each team can choose a level of difficulty to meet their objectives. We expect a minority of teams to collect all the checkpoints. The route will remain secret until the day before the race.

### Duration

The duration of the race will vary between 8 and 12 hours (per day) depending on your choice of routes, checkpoints and speed. There will be time barriers at different points during the race.


### Teams

Teams of 2 - men, women or mixed.

### Logistics

The organization will take care of transporting bins, bikes and kayaks if required. Teams will have access to their bins at certain transitions between disciplines. The kayak is supplied with your registration and the model will be as follows: https://www.rtmkayaks.com/optimo-evo-confort/
