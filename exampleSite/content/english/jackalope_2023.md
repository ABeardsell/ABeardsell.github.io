  The Jackalope Challenge is a multi-sport adventure race (mountain bike, run/trek and canoe) taking place over 2 days on May 27 and 28, 2023. This adventure race is part of the A1 Adventure Racing World Series: https://adventure1series.com/canada/. Teams will traverse ~150 km of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region, alternating between sports disciplines.

### What to expect

The Jackalope Challenge is a challenging endurance event. Although not reserved for athletes, you should have experience in all the disciplines involved in the race. During the race, you'll have to make decisions that will influence the length of the race (e.g., whether or not to go for certain checkpoints). To a certain extent, you'll be able to modulate your route according to your energy and motivation levels. The distances indicated below will vary according to your decisions and choice of checkpoints. Please note that there will be time barriers at certain stages of the race.

As the course is unmarked, teams will have to find their way to checkpoints using a compass and a detailed map. The course will remain secret until the day before the race.

You'll spend Saturday night in a rustic campsite, with no access to your vehicles. You will have access to one bin of equipment per person specifically for the camping night.

### Teams

Teams of two - men, women or co-ed.

### Logistics

The race organizers will transport bins, bikes and canoes if required. Teams will have access to bins during transitions.

### Duration

The duration of the race will vary between 8 and 12 hours (per day) depending on your choice of routes and speed.
